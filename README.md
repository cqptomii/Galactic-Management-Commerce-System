# UTBM-IF3E
In the case of the UE IF3E, the project was to create a game. 
We have decided to carry out the project Galactic Management Commerce System. The main goal of this project is to create an online space quest video game.
The player must complete missions to level up, buy new ships and teammates.
We used the following languages : Php, SQL, HTML and CSS.
You can find here all code pages, the report of the project and a quick video of an gameplay exemple.
